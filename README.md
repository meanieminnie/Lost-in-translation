# Lost-in-translation: Immigrant Communities Facing Language Barriers in NYC

Growing up, Shela Akhtar and her sister were made to miss school sometimes to accompany their parents to civil courts to fight against their negligent landlord. They weren’t their parents' lawyers, but their translators and interpreters. They would often have to translate and interpret conversations even during their own parent-teacher conferences.

Shela and her sister’s childhood experiences are similar to most children of first-generation immigrants in New York City. Shela said, “But we realized after growing up that we were given adult responsibility such as filing lawsuits, writing cheques for rent or translating for our parents as they were about to buy a house. All the while fearing that if we made a mistake, the blame would fall on our shoulders.”

According to MOIA, the top most spoken languages by immigrant New Yorkers are Spanish, Chinese, Russian, Bengali, Haitian, French, Arabic, Korean, Polish, Italian, Urdu and Tagalog.

These languages are also known as the ‘citywide designated languages’ according to Local Law 30. New Yorkers can request any city agency to provide official documents and communication, including telephonic help in a language other than English, as long as it is a designated language.

While Local Law 30 was established in 2017, with the aim of serving immigrant communities and immigrant-owned small businesses in New York City, it is far from perfect. Fatima Mazumder, a Bangladeshi second generation New Yorker, is reminded of her struggles despite Bengali being recognized as a citywide designated language. “Imagine going home knowing you did not get the job because you can not speak or understand English. Imagine getting ridiculed because you have not learned the language of the country you immigrated to. Imagine language being the biggest barrier in accessing governmental assistance in bringing food to the table and finding a home to live in," said Fatima.

New York City is home to almost sixty thousand people who don’t speak English proficiently. Out of these, around 14,000 have no access to government documents and services in a language they are proficient in.

After the pandemic disrupted lives and led to mass lay-offs, the lack of access to government documents and services in a preferred language left many distressed. Hashina Sumy, 21, from CCNY said, “During the pandemic as everyone was applying for unemployment benefits, my parents also lost their jobs. But because they were unable to understand the documents, they had difficulty applying. As their daughter I was happy to help my parents with the application process however I thought to myself why is it that it is so hard for my parents to apply for government benefits?”

MOIA’s role is to provide official translation and interpretation services to City agencies. It has a Language Services Team with dedicated language interpreters and translators. However, it remains unclear how many such professionals are employed at the moment.

Council member Shahana Hanif recently introduced a new bill in the City Council proposing that MOIA set up an Office of Translation and Interpretation to help more people get access to government communications and essential documents.
